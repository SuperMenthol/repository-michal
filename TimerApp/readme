# Application to count time upwards and downwards
# Four modes: 
#   timer (counting upwards), 
#   interval (indefinite cycling between main time and interval time),
#   pomodoro (same as above, with fixed main and interval times),
#   multiple intervals (cycling between main time and interval time, and a break after a defined amount of repetition cycles)
